## Overview

This Power BI project analyzes a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place. The dataset includes the date and time of each order, along with details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients of the pizzas served. The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the pizza place's sales and make data-driven decisions based on the analysis.

## Recommended Analysis

The following analysis questions were explored in this project:

1. **How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?**
   - Using the provided sales data, I analyzed the daily customer count and identified peak hours to understand customer behavior patterns.

2. **How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?**
   - Through data visualization and DAX measures, i examined the average number of pizzas per order and identified the top-selling pizzas.

3. **How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?**
   - By creating financial measures using DAX, i calculated the total revenue for the year and examined sales patterns for any seasonality.

4. **Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?**
   - I performed product analysis to identify underperforming pizzas and explore potential promotional opportunities.
